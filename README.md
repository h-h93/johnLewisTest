# johnLewisTest
Take home test for john lewis, created quickly using storyboard.
in hindsight would've preffered to have done it programmatically
i implemented a networking call class to structure the code a bit more, i used swift combine for the json parsing
for the dishwashers.
Json had a few issues/ errors so i had to counter those.
Testing has been done on ui ussage and display, performance testing was also carried out.
networking calls are done on main except image dl as that is costly, that was done on background.
images are being cached but nothing done with them yet, usually store in local db. currently just caching.
